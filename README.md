# Billing-Software

This Application is developed in several iterations.
Starting from Java SE to Java EE proceeding further to Spring.
A Sample Billing CRUD System  is assumed and developed using Business Entities.

1- Core Java CLI Application with MyBatis Persistence Framework with Postgresql Support.
2- Servlets and JSP Application as Part of Java EE (Same Database Support)
3- CLI Application Re-written using Spring Dependency Injection Framework.
4- Servlets and JSP Application is replaced with Spring MVC Rest API Application.

CLI Support -- UI Support -- API Support :)

Will try to elaborate the Readme.MD in further Commits. xD.
